![Baby Yoda gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/Wn74RUT0vjnoU98Hnt/giphy.gif)<br>

<br>

### Overview

> _Description of the project you'll be building with the objective described in non-technical language_

_**Project Title** is lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._

<br>


### MVP

> The Minimum Viable Product should be a well-planned and easily-communicated product, ensuring that the client's deliverable will be achievable and meet specifications within the time frame estimated.

_The **Project Title** MVP lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum. Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex. In quis fringilla velit, ac maximus quam. Etiam eget placerat neque. Aenean faucibus sem non nisi lobortis ullamcorper._

-_Rails Backend (API)_<br>
-_React Frontend_<br>
-_Authentication_<br>
-_At least 3 related models (User plus two others)_<br>
-_At least 1 association (one-to-many, many-to-many)_<br>
-_Full CRUD (can be spread between models)_<br>
-_Flexbox/Grid_<br>
-_Nicely styled, ready for your portfolio, and ready to show employees! (encouraged to use style libraries, Bulma, etc.)_<br>
-_Deployed on Surge/Heroku_<br>
-_Robust commit history (at least 5/day)_<br>
-_Code must be correctly indented and well styled (e.g., AirBnB Style Guide)_<br>
-_Remove console logs_<br>
-_README_<br>

<br>

#### Post-MVP Goals

- _Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet,_
- _consectetur adipiscing elit._
- _Phasellus dapibus fermentum risus vitae bibendum._
- _Integer vel ipsum mollis odio sollicitudin ornare eu vel ex._
- _etc._

<br>

### Wireframes

> _must be hifi (use Adobe XD or another professional mock-up service)_
_demonstrate the user experience - how will the user interact with the UI of your app?_

#### Component Hierarchy

>_break wireframe components down and describe in a component heirarchy_

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app.

```
src
|__ assets/
      |__ data-tests
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
      |__ Hero.jsx
      |__ Ipsum.jsx
      |__ Lorem.jsx
      |__ CTA.jsx
      |__ Footer.jsx
```

### ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)

-this cannot be drawn by hand
-use a professional tool, such as:
  -lucidchart
  -draw.io
  -ERDPlus

  User:

-Username PK
-Password
-Privilege Level (to be handled with PHP on webpage)

Posts:

-Post ID PK
-Username FK
-Title
-Content
-Time posted

Comments:

-Comment ID PK
-Post ID FK
-Username FK
-Content
-Time posted

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.

| Task                | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Add Contact Form    |    L     |     3 hrs      |     2 hrs     |    3 hrs    |
| Create CRUD Actions |    H     |     3 hrs      |     1 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL               |          |     6 hrs      |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

<br>

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._

#### Libraries and API Endpoint Documentation

> _Link to API Endpoint documentation (and any other 3rd party libraries you plan on incorporating)_

|     Library      | Description                                |

### SWOT Analysis

> _An explanation of the major challenges you expect to face while building this app_

_Strengths going into the project include my design skills and thoroughness in completion of projects. I pride myself on being very detail-oriented. Weaknesses and opportunities include learning more about how functions and classes are written in react. Threats include users not taking the happy path and writing in specific providers in the address bar, which I can account for and create a fix for that during the project._<br>
